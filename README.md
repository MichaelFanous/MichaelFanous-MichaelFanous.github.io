    <h3>What Makes me a good fit for the Snap Engineering Academy?</h3>
    <p class="paragraph2"> I am as driven as anyone. Some of my strengths include experiences within industry, working on projects with groups of others, a big thing I have noticed is to be successful in the space is that communication is key. Another major strength of mine is just that I constantly think, I have ideas floating around my head 24/7 on how can I improve something, or maybe even a startup idea.</p>
